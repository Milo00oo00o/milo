<h1>Book Summary</h1>

<p>Atomic Habits is James Clear's years of blog posts in one book. This book explains how basically improving ourselves
    1 percent every day results in a significant increase in our productivity but never counts those small changes as
    progress. Atomic Habits is a small change towards every day, by building systems and how to build better systems to
    achieve our goals. James mentions there are 4 laws of behavior change that we can use to create good habits and
    break the bad ones. He mentions as any habit is made of

<ol>
    <li>Cue</li>
    <li>Craving</li>
    <li>Response</li>
    <li>Reward</li>
</ol>

By making our behavior change according to these components, the habits fall into place thus resulting in building
better systems that ultimately make a good habit and break a bad one.</p>

<h2>What are habits?</h2>
<p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
    <br /><br />
    James goes on to explain how 1 percent of improvement on any topic of interest is exceptional as we gain 37% gain
    yearly statistically.<br /><br />

    The Habit loop helps us keep hitting us with small rewards that we tend to stay in the game longer. <br /> <br />

    He even mentions how habits and systems' main goal is not to win at a game. It is to continue playing the game.
