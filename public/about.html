<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a Project Engineer by profession and have found my passion for developing applications that can
  provide utility to co-workers at my current workplace</p>

<p>I chanced upon Dr. Angela Yu's Full-Stack Development Bootcamp on Udemy and decided to take this opportunity to
  self-study and try putting good use of knowledge gained.</p>

<p>My end goal is to build interactive webpages that consist of frontend framework(HTML,Javascript,CSS) as well as
  backend framework to build APIs and using PostgresSQL for database.</p>
