<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a Project Engineer by profession and have found my passion for developing applications that can
  provide utility at current workplace.</p>

<p>I chanced upon Dr. Angela Yu's Full-Stack Development Bootcamp on Udemy and decided to embark on a learning journey,
  trying
  to build interactive webpages using frontend and backend framework to build APIs and incorporating
  PostgresSQL for database.</p>
